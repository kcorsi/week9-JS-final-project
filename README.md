The purpose of this coding project is to master the concepts presented in the Javascript lessons in my front-end bootcamp.

This project is played in the console and includes an index.html and index.js file.

The project requirements for the completed WAR game include:

-Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.

-Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.

-The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point-- ties result in 0 for both Players.

-After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.
